## How Can I Create My Own?

- Block Modules and Items are created with **[Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/)**, I personally prefer this tool for creating my custom modules. It's beginner friendly and really easy to use.
- For coding I suggest you watch **[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSqSZoJQXvg&list=PLKGarocXCE1EeLZggaXPJaARxnAbUD8Y_)** youtube tutorial.[^2]

No! but I look forward to anyone that could contribute to me making it happen.
